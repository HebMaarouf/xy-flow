# XYFlow + Dagre Example

This repository contains a simple example of **XYFlow** integrated with **Dagre**.  

It demonstrates how to create a basic workflow diagram with automatic layout using Dagre's graph layout algorithms. The project is built with **React** (or specify your framework) and shows how nodes and edges can be organized and rendered programmatically.

## Features
- Simple XYFlow workflow setup
- Automatic graph layout using Dagre
- Easy to extend and customize
- Lightweight example for learning purposes

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
